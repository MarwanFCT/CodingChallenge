# Coding Challenge Athlon
###Fibonacci sequence
This challenge is based on the Fibonacci numbers. Here is an example who the sequence looks like:
•	0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...
Calculation
For the calculation of any number in the Fibonacci sequence you need 2 things.
1.	The starting point, which are 2 fixed numbers
2.	The calculation for any number n >= 2
Starting point
F0 = 0 F1 = 1
Formula
Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2
Challenge
Write a program, that is calculating the Fibonacci number (Fn) for a given input "n".
Challenge details
•	Any coding language can be used
•	No user input, the input should be hardcoded
•	A single execution of the program should process multiple inputs
•	The output should be on the console
•	The output should contain the input and output number
Bonus
As a bonus to the core challenge you can do the following:
•	Add "labels" for the numbers printed on the console
•	Add the time for a single calculation to the log message, in milliseconds with 3 decimals
•	Make sure that the calculation is still below 1 second for N: 
o	30, 40, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 10.000, 100.000
